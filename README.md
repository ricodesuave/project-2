# BookClub Application
During training we were asked to come up with a web application from the ground up. Working in a group of three, we came
up the idea of an online book community. Add books to your library, write reviews, and find clubs that may spark some interest.

What we learned:
- Angular/ Angular with Bootstrap
- Spring
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL
- Git
